        Licenses:
        * Add GPL3 licenses (fixes RT #72321).

          support (fixes RT #68634).

        * Make ignores_type an arrayref (closes Pull Request #8).
        * Add new --ignores parameter (also repeatable).
        * Add new --minperl parameter (Minimum Perl version).

        File Creation:

        * Make all warnings FATAL in created .t/.pm files.
        * Add config/build requires to Makefile/Build.PL.
        * Bulk up Module::Install Makefile.PL.
        * Fix ignores_guts to use different contents for MANIFEST.SKIP and
          other ignore files.

        test-dist.t Revamp:
        * Complete refactor of test-dist.t to make it more standardized.
        * Create new TestParseFile::parse_file_start method that handles
          parsing of all current created file types (outside of .pm files).
        * Use subtest for better organization.
        * Add verification that existing files are there and no new surprise
          files are not there.
        * Add new mega-loop to "test all variations of everything" (uses 1%
          sample size to keep test speed fast for average users).

        * Use .gitignore and MANIFEST.SKIP.

        (Patch provided by Alexandr Ciornii)

        * [RT #53339] ::Simple uses the builder to create the MANIFEST

        * Moved repository to Github

        * Some more refactoring in Simple::create_builder()

1.54    Tue Dec  8 09:11:00 CST 2009

        This release could not have happened without Sawyer X.

        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        Added more exclusions.  Thanks to Olivier Mengué.

        * [RT #45941] Correcting POD sections for Perl Critic (Sawyer X)

        * [RT #13847] Bail out if load fails, minimum Test::Harness (Sawyer X)

        * [RT #24110] Support for Test::CheckManifest + tests for it (Sawyer X)

        * [RT #22648] Pod::Parser (Pod::Usage) >= 1.21 (Sawyer X)
        (earliest Backpan version tested to work)

        * [RT #48723] Add metadata to META.yml (Sawyer X)
        (Patch provided by Olivier Mengué, thank you!)

        * [RT #39397] Add option to create .gitignore (Sawyer X)


1.52    Mon Jul 27 01:25:03 CDT 2009
        * Support for more licenses.  Thanks to Shlomi Fish.

        * Fix slashing problems for Windows.  Thanks Olivier Mengué.

        * Complains about extra unparsed options to try to detect
        problems that come out of misquoted variables. Thanks to Gunnar Wolf.

        * The list of files to ignore is now called ignore.txt,
        which you can turn into .cvsignore, .gitignore, MANIFEST.SKIP
        or whatever.

        * Handles authors with apostrophes in their names better.
        Thanks to, not surprisingly, Dave O'Neill.

        * Removed module requirements on Test::Pod and Test::Pod::Coverage
        for Module::Starter to be built and installed.  However,
        t/pod.t and t/pod-coverage.t do still both get created even
        if either of their two main modules are not installed.


1.50    Tue Oct 28 00:27:37 CDT 2008
        * Added Perl Training Australia's getting-started.html

        * Add license setting to default Makefile.PL output (Thanks, Gabor!)

1.46    Fri Nov  9 18:36 America/New_York 2007
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        * add Module::Install compat for ::Template plugin
        * boilerplate.t no longer appears in default MANIFEST
        * META.yml no longer appears in default MANIFEST

        [FIXES]
        * undo some bugs introduced by changing API of subclassable "guts"
          methods
        * remove some duplicated code

1.46    Wed Oct 31 08:49 America/New_York 2007
        * put nearly all of the module-starter program into a module (to test)
        * add license to META.yml

1.44    Sun Oct 11 19:09 America/New_York 2007
        * no changes since 1.43_03

1.43_03
        [FIXES]
        * pod-coverage.t includes Pod::Coverage version check
        * Test::Pod and Test::Pod::Coverage are now requirements.
            Thanks, David Golden.

1.43_02 Wed Apr 25 09:37-Wed May 09 14:46 PDT 2007	<cjac@colliertech.org>
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        * broke Module::Starter::Simple's README_guts and module_guts
          methods into smaller, override-able pieces
        * re-factored Module::Starter::Simple's build system; the
          build metadata now lives in Module::Starter::BuildSet.  This
          allows us access to the metadata from the test suite.  It
          also makes it a bit easier to add supported builders.
        * added a test Plugin module (based on Module::Starter::PBP)
        * wrote a test suite for running module-starter
        * wrote a test suite for Module::Starter::BuildSet
        * modified the critic Makefile target to name the policy which
          raised the violation
        * Split most long lines (>80 chars) on whitespace

        [FIXES]
        * Ensured that perlcritic succeeds without errors or warnings
        * Added perlcriticrc to the MANIFEST
        * corrected build -> builder in module-starter --help docs

1.43_01 Wed Mar 28 12:21:00 EDT 2007
        [FIXES]
        * Now properly reports on all files in --verbose mode.

        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        * Add support for Module::Install

1.42    Wed Nov  9 11:25:10 CST 2005
        [FIXES]
        * Don't build Build.PL or Makefile.PL multiple times
        * Move Test::More from require to build_require in Build.PL

        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        * Documentation now includes references to search.cpan, AnnoCPAN,
          RT and CPAN Ratings.
        * Email addresses are now obfuscated very basically as
          "andy at petdance.com".

        * Experimental new method to handle plugin loading

1.40    Wed Jul  6 19:30:00 CDT 2005

        [FIXES]
        * Don't allow invalid module names

        [FIXES]
        * 00.load.t is now 00-load.t, so VMS and RiscOS folks can use it.
        * Escape apostrophes in author name in Makefile.PL
        * Add a link directly to this dist's queue in RT, not just to RT
        * Don't set configdir to something in $HOME if it's undef

1.34    Mon Sep 20 19:15:00 CDT 2004
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        * module-starter now reads a config file

1.30    Mon Aug 16 14:00:00 CDT 2004
        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        * Module::Starter::Simple, the old M::S is now a plugin
        * Module::Starter::Plugin::Template added
        * module-starter now shows usage if no parms are passed.
        * The t/pod.t and t/pod-coverage.t files now use tainting,

          Test::Pod::Coverage, respectively.

1.22    Mon Jul 12 17:05:26 CDT 2004

        [FIXES]

        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        * Moved some data (distro, basedir) from parameters to object data
        * Moved some data (rtname) from routine-local to parameter data
        * Correted lies in POD regarding args to create_distro
        * Every create_file method now calls a file_guts method to get
          contents.
        * All the quoted POD inline should now not render in perldoc.
        * The module-build script now respects --class
        * Minor refactoring of parameters to create_directory and _module
        * Everything is now an overridable object method.  Thanks to
          Ricardo Signes.
        * Added verbose() method.
        * Added progress() method so subclass can decide how progress
          is reported.

        All of the above is courtesy the diligent work of Ricard Signes.

1.00    Fri Jun 25 17:57:31 CDT 2004

        * Added a README file.  The README file is somewhat intelligently
          constructed, too.
        * Now you can specify both EU::MM and M::B as your builders,
          so the module can have a double life.

        Thanks to Sébastien Aperghis-Tramonifor the help.
