=head1 NAME

Module::Starter::Simple - a simple, comprehensive Module::Starter plugin

=head1 VERSION

Version 1.58

=cut

our $VERSION = '1.58';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Module::Starter qw(Module::Starter::Simple);

    Module::Starter->create_distro(%args);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Module::Starter::Simple is a plugin for Module::Starter that will perform all
the work needed to create a distribution.  Given the parameters detailed in
L<Module::Starter>, it will create content, create directories, and populate
the directories with the required files.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=head2 C<< new(%args) >>

This method is called to construct and initialize a new Module::Starter object.
It is never called by the end user, only internally by C<create_distro>, which
creates ephemeral Module::Starter objects.  It's documented only to call it to
the attention of subclass authors.

=cut

sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    return bless { @_ } => $class;
}

=head1 OBJECT METHODS

All the methods documented below are object methods, meant to be called
internally by the ephemeral objects created during the execution of the class
method C<create_distro> above.

=head2 postprocess_config

A hook to do any work after the configuration is initially processed.

=cut

sub postprocess_config { 1 };

=head2 pre_create_distro

A hook to do any work right before the distro is created.

=cut

sub pre_create_distro { 1 };

=head2 C<< create_distro(%args) >>

This method works as advertised in L<Module::Starter>.

=cut

sub create_distro {
    my $either = shift;

    ( ref $either ) or $either = $either->new( @_ );

    my $self    = $either;
    my $modules = $self->{modules} || [];
    my @modules = map { split /,/ } @{$modules};
    croak "No modules specified.\n" unless @modules;
    for (@modules) {
        croak "Invalid module name: $_" unless /\A[a-z_]\w*(?:::[\w]+)*\Z/i;
    }

    croak "Must specify an author\n" unless $self->{author};
    croak "Must specify an email address\n" unless $self->{email};

    $self->{main_module} = $modules[0];
    if ( not $self->{distro} ) {
        $self->{distro} = $self->{main_module};
        $self->{distro} =~ s/::/-/g;
    }

    $self->{basedir} = $self->{dir} || $self->{distro};
    $self->create_basedir;

    my @files;
    push @files, $self->create_modules( @modules );

    push @files, $self->create_t( @modules );
    push @files, $self->create_ignores;
    my %build_results = $self->create_build();
    push(@files, @{ $build_results{files} } );

    push @files, $self->create_Changes;
    push @files, $self->create_README( $build_results{instructions} );

    $self->create_MANIFEST( $build_results{'manifest_method'} ) unless ( $self->{manifest_skip} );
    # TODO: put files to ignore in a more standard form?
    # XXX: no need to return the files created

    return;
}

=head2 post_create_distro

A hook to do any work after creating the distribution.

=cut

sub post_create_distro { 1 };

=head2 pre_exit

A hook to do any work right before exit time.

=cut

sub pre_exit {
     print "Created starter directories and files\n";
}

=head2 create_basedir

Creates the base directory for the distribution.  If the directory already
exists, and I<$force> is true, then the existing directory will get erased.

If the directory can't be created, or re-created, it dies.

=cut

sub create_basedir {
    my $self = shift;

    # Make sure there's no directory
    if ( -e $self->{basedir} ) {
        die( "$self->{basedir} already exists.  ".
             "Use --force if you want to stomp on it.\n"
            ) unless $self->{force};

        local @ARGV = $self->{basedir};
        rm_rf();

        die "Couldn't delete existing $self->{basedir}: $!\n"
          if -e $self->{basedir};
    }

    CREATE_IT: {
        $self->progress( "Created $self->{basedir}" );

        local @ARGV = $self->{basedir};
        mkpath();

        die "Couldn't create $self->{basedir}: $!\n" unless -d $self->{basedir};
    }

    return;
}

=head2 create_modules( @modules )

This method will create a starter module file for each module named in
I<@modules>.

=cut

sub create_modules {
    my $self = shift;
    my @modules = @_;

    my @files;

    for my $module ( @modules ) {
        my $rtname = lc $module;
        $rtname =~ s/::/-/g;
        push @files, $self->_create_module( $module, $rtname );
    }

    return @files;
}

=head2 module_guts( $module, $rtname )

This method returns the text which should serve as the contents for the named
module.  I<$rtname> is the email suffix which rt.cpan.org will use for bug
reports.  (This should, and will, be moved out of the parameters for this
method eventually.)

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the README
file from a module distribution so that people browsing the archive
can use it to get an idea of the module's uses. It is usually a good idea
to provide version information here so that people can decide whether
fixes for the module are worth downloading.
